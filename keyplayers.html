<h> Clinton's Web of Women</h>

<p class="Monica"> Monica Lewinsky is the young woman whose life was turned upside down following an affair with the then President Bill Clinton during his time in office. While she has since become an anti-bullying activist, motivational speaker, and has dabbled in a few entrepreneurial endeavors -- Lewinsky spent years struggling to find not only a job but also a self-identity outside of the scandal. </p>

<p class= "Juanita"> In 1999, after once declaring otherwise in a sworn statement, Broaddrick alleged that President Bill Clinton raped her in April 1978 while he was the Attorney General of Arkansas. Clinton's attorney denied the allegations on his client's behalf, and Clinton declined to comment further on the issue. Among the claims of Clinton’s sexual misconduct that emerged during the 1990s, Broaddick’s claims are the most serious (even though Ken Starr mentioned them only as a footnote in his final report).</p>

<p class "Kathleen"> Kathleen Willey is a former White House volunteer aide who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault on March 15, 1998 in a televisión interview with 60 Minutes.

<p class= "Paula Jones"> Paula Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who sued president Bill Clinton for sexual harassment, and her case provided the impetus for Ken Starr to broaden his investigation into Clinton's financial dealings. Moreover, during the Paula Jones suit, Clinton denied under oath that he ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky and was thus accused of perjury. The Jones lawsuit set a landmark legal precedent that a sitting U.S. president is not exempt from civil litigation for acts committed outside of public office>

<p class "Vernon Jordan"> A member of Clinton’s 1992-93 transition team and longtime advisor and friend of Bill Clinton, Jordan limited his interactions with Lewinsky to two specific occasions in a public statement: “"I assisted her in trying to find employment... I referred her for interviews at American Express... At her request, I recommended a very competent Washington lawyer... I actually took her to Mr. Carter's office, I introduced them, and I returned to my office. I want to say to you absolutely and unequivocally that Ms. Lewinsky told me in no uncertain terms that she did not have a sexual relationship with the president.” He was subpoenaed during the trial. </p>
