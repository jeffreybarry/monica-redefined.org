<h1>The Tripp Tapes</h1>

<img src="images/lindatripp.jpg"
alt="Photo from the Washington Post of Linda Tripp">

<p>Linda Tripp befriended and betrayed Monica by recording nearly 20 hours of personal conversations over three months in 1997 and 1998. Tripp became a key witness for Independent Counsel's Kenneth Starr. Tripp, who was 27 years older than Monica, worked in the Pentagon’s public affairs office. She acted like a mentor to Monica before she turned over the tapes to Starr.</p>

<h2> Email Transcripts </h2>

<p>While Tripp and Monica worked in the Pentagon, the two women exchanged frequent e-mails on their office computers. They often held lengthy back and forth conversations in a single day. Many of the conversations focused on Monica's rocky relationship with President Clinton. </p>

     <p class="card-text">Good morning. Are you there today? Just checking. Between reading that book you loaned me (unadolterated trash, how very fitting . . .) and our conversations, I swear, I had a dream featuring you and the big creep. Nothing spectacular, just conversation in the Roosevelt Room. Bizarre. Maybe we can get away for a few minutes for coffee or something.</p>

Although I must warn you that I am horrible company today. I read that [deleted] is going away next week on domestic trips to promote the lame [deleted]! . . . I wonder if Betty will call me. . . .

     <p class="card-text">You are right about my “bad” habit of jumping down people’s throats sometimes….can you laugh even when you’re mad at me? I know that sometimes I am difficult with you, and I am sorry because I know that you do not have to endure that from me. I did not ever mean for my remarks to be “biting”, and I am just paranoid about doing something to lose this job. I am hyper-sensitive to that fear because of what happened before — this is not an excuse, more like an explanation. I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR FRIENDSHIP. I hope that in the future, if there is a future, you let me know sooner when I do something that bothers you. It seems that this has been sitting for awhile. Of course, that is prefaced with me trying to not be a b*tch.</p>

And don’t accuse me of somehow “skewing” the truth — because the reality is that what I told you is true. I really am finished, Monica.

I would only like to ask that I have your assurance everything I have shared with you remains between us. You have given me your word before, but that was when we were on good terms. Can I still trust that?</p>
