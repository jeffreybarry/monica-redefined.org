      <h2>What did she do after the scandal?</h2>
      <p>Struggling to regain her footing after the publicity of the trial and affair, Monica experimented with several different business ventures in the late 90s-2000s. These include a guest host spot on Saturday Night Live, her own handbag line, and a role as a host for a dating reality show, Mr. Peronality. These ventures were short lived and received a great deal of critism. </p>
      <p>In 1999, Monica appeared as a guest host on SNL. The skits consisted of spoofs and sly references toward her experiences with Bill Clinton. </p>

      <p>The same year, Monica attempted to break into the fashion industry by designed a handbag line. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/monica-lewinsky-had-a-handbag-line-20-years-ago-i-set-out-to-find-one" target="_blank">The Daily Beast</a> recently reviewed the line with a modern day criticism.</p>
      <p>In 2003, Monica became the host of reality television dating show, Mr. Personality.</p>

    <h2>Darkness</h2>
    <p>Since 1998, over 70 rap songs have used her last name as a verb, dehumanizing the person behind the punchline. After becoming a household name, Lewinsky only recently re-introduced herself to the public as the smart, talented, and passionate woman she’s always been.</p>
