<!-- Bit about Monica going public in Vanity Fair for the first time goes here: talk to Lauren and Professor Locy about what to write/how to designate it differently from what is below the header -->

<p> In 2014, Monica Lewinsky went public for the first time in more than <!-- check this --> 10 years. </p>

<h2> Vanity Fair: May 2014 </h2>
<p>
"So why speak now? Because it is <b>time</b>. I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past‚Äîand other people‚Äôs futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I‚Äôve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past."

<p>
After 10 years of "self-imposed reticence," Monica Lewinsky reintroduced herself to the world in May of 2014 with these powerful words. Her Vanity Fair article <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture" target="_blank">Shame and Survival</a> gave her a chance to tell the world her side of the story.
</p>

<h2> Monica on Twitter: October 2014 </h2>

<p>
Only 5 months after her Vanity Fair article ran, Monica amplified her voice even more. By joining Twitter, she was diving headfirst into the online community that once made her life a living nightmare. Her first tweet on October 20, 2014 read:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HereWeGo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HereWeGo</a></p>&mdash; Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/524184076450684928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2> The tedTalk: March 2015 </h2>

<p> After 10 months of gradual reintroduction into the public eye, Monica gave the tedTalk that would truly kickstart her new chapter. "The Price of Shame" provided a platform allowing her to publicly discuss the media firestorm of 1998. She referred to herself as "Patient Zero" of losing reputation on a public scale as a result of the 24 hour media cycle. </p>

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p> Following her talk, Monica tweeted this: </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WHEW! ...so what did you do today?... thanks to all for the kind supportive comments. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gratitude?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gratitude</a></p>&mdash; Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/578695815239196672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2> Back in Vanity Fair: March 2018 </h2>

<p> As the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/metoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag" target="_blank">#metoo</a> movement took off, women across the world began to share their stories of sexual harassment. For years, Monica had firmly maintained that her relationship with Bill Clinton was consensual. She had echoed that sentiment in her first essay for Vanity Fair. This time was different. She penned <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/monica-lewinsky-in-the-age-of-metoo" target="_blank">Emerging from "The House of Gaslight" in the Age of #metoo</a> as the first admission that her relationship with the President of the United States as a 22-year-old was laced with problems. </p>

<blockquote class="implications"> ‚ÄúNow, at 44, I‚Äôm beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern. I‚Äôm beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances‚Äîand the ability to abuse them‚Äîdo exist even when the sex has been consensual.)‚Äù </blockquote>

<p> In conjuction with this article, Monica became a contributing editor to Vanity Fair in 2018. </p>

<h2> John Oliver: March 2019 </h2>

<p> Monica took a big step in early 2019 as she sat for an interview with John Oliver, a comedian who had made jokes at her expense during the events of 1998. Oliver apologized for how he spoke about her at the time and used her presence as a way to draw attention to the culture of public shaming present in today's online world. </p>

<h2> These Days, Monica is: </h2>

<h3> an anti-bullying activist, </h3>

<p> She is a strategic advisor for <a href="https://www.bystanderrevolution.org/" target="_blank">Bystander Revolution</a> and recently took part in the launch of an interactive anti-cyber bullying campaign entitled <a href="https://www.the-epidemic.com/" target="_blank">The Epidemic.</a> The campaign utilizes text messages to illustrate to viewers the far-reaching consequences of cyberbullying. </p>

<h3> a producer, </h3>
<p> It was announced in August of 2019 that Lewinsky would join American Crime Story as a producer for their series on the Clinton impeachment. The series will premiere on September 27, 2020. </p>

<h3> sharing her message on college campuses, </h3>
<p> Lewinsky spoke on Washington and Lee's campus on October 16, 2019. Her talk, entitled "A discussion about survival, resilience, digital reputation and equality" sold out and allowed students, many of whom were not born in 1998, to put a face to a name many of them might only know from rap songs. </p>

<p> Shortly after Monica spoke on campus, The New York Times' Chief White House Reporter, Peter Baker, visited Lexington as well. Baker covered the Clinton Administration for the Washington Post when the Lewinsky story broke, and we had the opportunity to revisit that experience with him 20 years later. </p>

<h3> and keeping it realer than ever on Twitter. </h3>

<p> Andy Warhol once said that "in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." Monica Lewinsky has been world famous for far longer than that. In fact, if we're counting, it has been exactly <!-- insert timer here --> minutes since Monica Lewinsky's name became a household one.</p>

<p> But, Monica has not allowed 1998 to be the last chapter in her story. She's used the fame and notoriety and has turned it into something good. In reintroducing herself to society, she's begun to take back her name.</p>

<blockquote>  "Monica Lewinsky" has been redefined. </blockquote>
