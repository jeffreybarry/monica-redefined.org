        <p>I first heard the name Monica Lewinsky 10 years after her reputation was shattered by the media and six years before she would launch herself back into the public.</p>
<p>I was 9 years old, and the 2008 presidential election was in full swing. My elementary school was holding a mock election, and I had not given any thought to politics before.</p>
<p>Naturally, I had a lot of questions for my mom.</p>
<p>She walked me through the presidencies she had lived through, but I stopped her at Bill Clinton because I did not understand when she said he was impeached. Explaining in terms that a 9-year-old could understand, she said he was fired because he lied about cheating on his wife with a woman named Monica Lewinsky who had worked in the White House.</p>
<p>I remember telling my mom that I was sad for Clinton’s wife. But I had little-to-no concept of relationships, politics, or the legal system at the time, so I was pretty much satisfied with that answer.</p>
<p>My mom used the opportunity to reiterate to her young daughter the importance of honesty.</p>
<p>But Lewinsky was not the focus of that conversation, and hers was not a name I gave much thought until this project.</p>
<p>Now in 2019, Monica’s name means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Having grown up in an age dominated by social media, I have been taught since the age of 12 to be cautious about what I share online. Between lectures by parents and countless programs in middle schools and high schools, my generation has been warned that we must be aware of how our personal reputations can be demolished if the wrong information is shared online.</p>
<p>I have witnessed friends suffer from cyberbullying in catastrophic ways.</p>
<p>But Monica did not grow up in a time where people understood the detrimental effects of media-shaming. She was, though, “Patient Zero” in the digital destruction of a person’s reputation, as she described herself in a 2015 Ted Talk.</p>
<p>Not even the media had a full of understanding of the effect it could have on a person’s reputation.</p>
<p>Every detail of Monica’s life and relationship with Clinton was shared with the public. And all of this information about her was shared without her permission.</p>
<p>Having taken a multitude of journalism and media classes, I feel that if this happened now, someone in Monica’s position would be treated much more gently by the media—at least I hope.</p>
<p>I have also come into adulthood in the era of #MeToo, a conversation that did not exist when the media took Monica’s situation and shamed her on a viral scale.</p>
<p>When I had the opportunity to see Monica speak emotionally on these topics in person, I gained a newfound appreciation for her.</p>
<p>It shocks me that she can find the strength to speak publicly about the matter, and it is inspiring how she now commits so much of her life to anti-bullying activism.</p>
<p>After what happened to her, it would be understandable if she stayed away from the spotlight.</p>
<p>But her voice is the one we need to hear. And I am so grateful that I did.</p>

      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>During this 2019 semester-long class, we’ve marveled that we are now the age that Monica was when the scandal broke.</p>
        <p>I was three days old when her affair became public knowledge. I only knew my mother and father’s arms. My 2-year-old sister’s eyes. The white room, the incubator, and the unconscious realization that leaving the sterile hospital would bring an unfamiliar and scary dawning of possibilities. I had been thrust into a world without my sentient consent or participation.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Monica was also thrust into a scary and unfamiliar world. While I was new to it, she became news to it.</p>
        <p>Monica had grown up with the unbeknownst luxury of anonymity, simply another face in the crowd. On Jan. 21, 1998, she was reborn as the ‘new’ Monica: a woman whose only purpose could be to service a man, a vixen who had enticed the President to stray.</p>
        <p>Without her permission, the most intimate details of her personal life were suddenly daytime television. A 22-year-old White House intern eviscerated in public, blamed for an affair with a married 52-year-old man who held the most powerful job in the United States.</p>
        <p>Stripped of her of dignity and privacy, a relationship that comprised less than 10% of her life became her lifelong defining narrative. In rap songs, “Lewinsky” became a verb meaning to engage in oral sex, or something of an equally salacious nature.</p>
        <p>Now, almost 22 years later, Monica’s journey has been a testament of her ability to move from subsistence to persistence to prevail.</p>
        <p>Nadia Petschek Rawls, TED’s social media editor, was in charge of monitoring Monica’s 2014 Ted Talk, “The Price of Shame” --- one of Lewinsky’s first public appearances in years<em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
        <p>“As soon as her talk went up on Facebook, in too little time for anyone to have actually watched the 20-minute video, the comment thread was deluged with vitriol and hatred,” <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/want-to-help-prevent-online-bullying-comment-on-facebook/">wrote Rawls</a>. “People called her a slut and a whore, made jokes about sucking dick, and said she deserves the shaming because “shaming is an important part of how we shape our culture.””<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p>Rawls raises an important point. As the social media correspondent for Ted, she received a fraction of the harassment Monica has been facing since 1998 just by monitoring the comment thread of the talk. As a young woman myself, I do not know if I could have faced the years of torment.</p>
        <p>MonicaRedefined is our small step in showcasing how “that woman” is working to reclaim her own story and use her experience to help others. Now, in 2019, we are finding a new narrative that sheds light on sexual harassment stemming from a power imbalance. We are finding new definitions of consent. We are, slowly but surely, creating spaces that foster discussion on important topics. As young women today, it is up to us to confront biased and unexamined histories to influence a society that no longer defaults on bullying and shame.</p>

        <p>I have never left a speech, talk, performance, or interview feeling as empowered as a woman as I did after speaking personally with Monica.</p>
        <p>She is such an important role model of survival for women our age. If I am being completely honest, I did not expect her to be so open when speaking with our student body, and I certainly did not expect this to be the course of our project either.</p>
        <p>When we registered for this class, we did not know what the topic would be. I was intrigued after learning that we would be redesigning the Washington Post archive on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.</p>
        <p>I had not formed an opinion about Monica before this class. I knew the public’s version of Monica, but not her version of the <del>a</del> private Monica.</p>
        <p>My parents were not as excited as I was when I told them that our class would focus on the scandal. Their view of Monica was constructed by the media back in 1998.</p>
        <p>I certainly carried some of this bias at the beginning of the class, before I learned about Monica, as a human being. The work in the class has opened my eyes to how the media can shape and ruin a person overnight.</p>
        <p>But, after hearing Monica speak at W&amp;L, my mindset and our project changed—overnight.</p>
        <p>Especially after my classmates and I sat down with Monica after her speech. We knew that we wanted to shift our project to redefining her past, present, and her future. Her intelligence, realness, and willingness to speak to the five of us, plus several other female students, is something I will never forget.</p>
        <p>Even when we weren't speaking about politics or her past, she genuinely wanted to offer us advice through sharing personal stories.</p>
        <p>We collectively agreed that the Monica we saw that night is the Monica that the world never heard about or cared to understand in 1998.</p>
        <p>Back then, the world saw a Monica that was constructed as a “tramp, a tart, a slut, a floozy, and, of course, “that woman,” as President Clinton referred to her in a nationally televised statement.</p>
        <p>Most people did not see the 22-year-old woman who fell in love and made a mistake.</p>
        <p>They did not see the human who was in front of the cameras—against her will.</p>
        <p>They did not define the word “consent” as we do today.</p>
        <p>Nor did they appreciate how painful it must’ve been for Monica to experience revelations about her personal and intimate private life.</p>
        <p>I can only hope that most people can view Monica differently today, especially in a world saturated with media scandals and cyberbullying.</p>
        <p>I am optimistic that this website will provide readers with a new narrative about Monica.</p>
        <p>More than 20 years after the scandal, it is time to redefine her.</p>

        <p>Reflection Essay</p>
        <p>Resilience is one of my most deep-seated weaknesses. <em><strong>It</strong></em> is a quality I have always admired in others and attempt to replicate.</p>
        <p>When I receive a poor grade on an exam, I pout.</p>
        <p>When a friend dishes criticism, even the constructive kind, a pit swells in the bottom of my stomach.</p>
        <p><em><strong>I struggle to pretend that I am thick-skinned, that I am resilient.</strong></em></p>
        <p>After <em><strong>10</strong></em> years in hiding, Monica Lewinsky transformed her raw shame and grief into benevolence, poise and prudence.</p>
        <p>Her resilience has inspired me throughout the development of this project.</p>
        <p>As a 22-year-old woman myself, I cannot imagine one of my (many) mistakes exploding in front of the entire United States of America.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, when Ms. Lewinsky spoke on Washington and Lee’s campus a couple months ago, her personality radiated. <em><strong>She was charismatic, thoughtful, confident, and funny.</strong></em></p>
        <p>She <em><strong>also made insightful comments about</strong></em> mental health, the media, the digital revolution, and, most importantly to me, feminism.</p>
        <p><em><strong>In public appearances in recent years,</strong></em> Monica <em><strong>has</strong></em> explained the nuances of her life--her aspirations before the White House, her relationships with friends and family, and how she has coped with the consequences of the scandal.</p>
        <p>As if this on-stage exposé was not enough, I along with a small handful of other college women also had the privilege of speaking with Monica in a more intimate setting. <em><strong>She was candid in responding to our questions. Her answers seemed heartfelt to us. In short, she</strong></em> was captivating.</p>
        <p>At the end of the conversation, a <em><strong>young woman</strong></em> in our group offered a concluding statement of gratitude that I could not have articulated better myself: attending a school founded by and for men, sometimes we (women) feel the sharp sense that this campus was indeed not built for us.</p>
        <p><em><strong>I have rarely felt such a strong sense of belonging as I did</strong></em> talking with Ms. Lewinsky about double standards, gender stereotypes, slut-shaming, and the like--particularly among a group of strong and intelligent female college students.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the semester, this project has grown increasingly important to me as our audience, our message, and our goals have evolved.</p>
        <p>I want <em><strong>our project to provide a counterpoint to</strong></em> the media’s negative construction of “that woman.”</p>
        <p>But I also want this site to resonate with young women today.</p>
        <p>I want young women to consider the power imbalances, the breaches in confidence, and the misfortune Ms. Lewinsky <em><strong>experienced, including sex-based disrespect and denigration</strong></em> in over 140 rap songs.</p>
        <p>I hope this website prompts users to reevaluate their <em><strong>judgments</strong></em> of the 1998 narrative<em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
        <p>I hope young women ask, just like I did, how this <em><strong>scandal was named after her, labeled</strong></em> the “Lewinsky scandal.” <em><strong>It should’ve been named after Clinton and Clinton alone.</strong></em></p>
        <p>I hope that this website sparks a sense of pride and hope among young women, <em><strong>giving them license to take control of their own stories.</strong></em></p>

        <p>Monica Lewinsky is one of the rare people in the world that everyone, no matter how old or young they are, knows her name.</p>
        <p>When I learned that we would be redesigning the Washington Post archive on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, my first thought was “this is going to be quite the project.”</p>
        <p>That still rings true, but not in the way I expected it would.</p>
        <p>I began this experience knowing of Monica as she was portrayed in the media, as the history books describe her, as my parents’ generation conceives of her.</p>
        <p>How wrong all of that is.</p>
        <p>There’s a disparity between who Monica “is” and who she actually is. <em><strong>The disparity became more pronounced as</strong></em> I began reading past stories written about her while also looking at how she has <em><strong>emerged from what can only be described as exile.</strong></em></p>
        <p>She has an intelligence about her that is obvious as soon as she speaks. She is unafraid of owning her past while keeping her focus on what is to come.</p>
        <p>She has a capacity to forgive and a willingness to move on from what happened to her, though others might remain stuck on that for the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p><em><strong>I told my mom that Monica was one of my role models after I heard her speak and I had the opportunity to meet her<del>. </del></strong></em></p>
        <p>My mom (mostly) jokingly responded, “Except for the part about having sex in the Oval Office I hope.”</p>
        <p>That comment gave me momentary pause. My mom has three daughters and could not be more supportive of us. She is a cool mom. I can tell her anything. And yet when I told her that I admired Monica Lewinsky, someone I had come to view as a pillar of strength and resilience in the face of unimaginable adversity, she diminished her <em><strong>by focusing on</strong></em> that one mistake.</p>
        <p>After my mom made that comment, I explained that I saw a lot of myself in Monica. What she went through was far worse than what I endured, but I understood it. Traumatic experience does strange things to people: some thrive and perform at their best; some crumble under the pressure; <strong>and</strong> some go into self-preservation mode.</p>
        <p>Monica has taken her trauma and used it as fuel to make positive change in the world.</p>
        <p>She didn’t let one mistake define her no matter how hard everyone else tried to.</p>
        <p>She owns the experience, owns her name, owns it all.</p>
        <p>That’s why I admire her, because she doesn’t let the worst thing that ever happened to her be the last thing people hear from her.</p>
        <p>She’s reclaiming her name and if that isn’t admirable, I don’t know what is.</p>
