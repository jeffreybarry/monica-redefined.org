<!-- Bit about Monica going public in Vanity Fair for the first time goes here: talk to Lauren and Professor Locy about what to write/how to designate it differently from what is below the header -->

<p> In 2014, Monica went public for the first time in more than 10 years. </p>

<h2> Vanity Fair: May 2014 </h2>
<blockquote>
"So why speak now? Because it is <strong>time</strong>. I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past‚Äîand other people‚Äôs futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I‚Äôve decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past."
</blockquote>

<p>After her "self-imposed reticence," Monica reintroduced herself to the world in May 2014 in Vanity Fair. Her essay <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture" target="_blank">Shame and Survival</a> gave her a chance to tell the world her side of the story.</p>

<h2>Monica on Twitter: October 2014</h2>

<p>Only five months after her essay, Monica amplified her by joining Twitter. She was diving headfirst into the online community that once made her life a living nightmare. Her first tweet on Oct. 20, 2014, read:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HereWeGo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HereWeGo</a></p>&mdash; Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/524184076450684928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>The TED Talk: March 2015</h2>

<p>Monica gave the TED Talk on March 19, 2015 that kickstarted her new chapter. "The Price of Shame" provided a platform that allowed her to publicly discuss the media firestorm of 1998. She referred to herself as "Patient Zero," who lost her reputation becase of the 24-hour media cycle.</p>

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/monica_lewinsky_the_price_of_shame" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<p>Following her talk, Monica tweeted:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WHEW! ...so what did you do today?... thanks to all for the kind supportive comments. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gratitude?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gratitude</a></p>&mdash; Monica Lewinsky (@MonicaLewinsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/578695815239196672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Back in Vanity Fair: March 2018</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/metoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag" target="_blank">#metoo</a> movement took off, women across the world began to share their stories of sexual harassment. For years, Monica had firmly maintained that her relationship with Bill Clinton was consensual. She had echoed that sentiment in her first essay for Vanity Fair. This time was different. She penned <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/monica-lewinsky-in-the-age-of-metoo" target="_blank">Emerging from "The House of Gaslight" in the Age of #metoo.</a> In it, she admitted for the first time that her relationship as a 22-year-old with the President of the United States was problematic.</p>

<blockquote class="implications">‚ÄúNow, at 44, I‚Äôm beginning (just beginning) to consider the implications of the power differentials that were so vast between a president and a White House intern. I‚Äôm beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot. (Although power imbalances‚Äîand the ability to abuse them‚Äîdo exist even when the sex has been consensual.)‚Äù</blockquote>

<p>Monica became a contributing editor to Vanity Fair in 2018.</p>

<h2>John Oliver: March 2019</h2>

<p>Monica took a big step in early 2019 as she sat for an interview with John Oliver, a comedian who had made jokes at her expense during the events of 1998. Oliver apologized for how he spoke about her and used her presence as a way to draw attention to the culture of public shaming present in today's online world.</p>

<h2>Today, Monica is:</h2>

<h3>an anti-bullying activist,</h3>

<p>She is a strategic adviser for <a href="https://www.bystanderrevolution.org/" target="_blank">Bystander Revolution</a> and recently took part in the launch of an interactive anti-cyberbullying campaign entitled <a href="https://www.the-epidemic.com/" target="_blank">"The Epidemic.""</a> The campaign utilizes text messages to illustrate to viewers the far-reaching consequences of cyberbullying.</p>

<h3>a producer,</h3>
<p>It was announced in August 2019 that Monica would join American Crime Story, a true crime television series. She will co-produce a miniseries on the Clinton impeachment. It will premiere on Sep. 27, 2020.</p>

<h3>sharing her message on college campuses,</h3>
<p>Monica spoke on Washington and Lee's campus on Oct. 16, 2019. Organizaers handed out 514 tickets for her talk, "A discussion about survival, resilience, digital reputation and equality." Many of the students in the audience were not born in 1998, but her talk put a face to a name many of them might only know from pop culture.</p>

<p>Shortly after Monica spoke on campus, New York Times Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker visited Lexington as well. Baker covered the Clinton Administration for the Washington Post when the story about Monica broke. We had the opportunity to to talk to him about his news coverage 20 years later.</p>

<!-- Peter Baker interview video goes here. Cut in Final Cut and show to Professor Locy. -->

<h3>and keeping it real on Twitter.</h3>

<p>Andy Warhol once said that "in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes." Monica has been world-famous for far longer than that. It has been exactly <!-- insert timer here --> <span id="elapsedTime"> </span>minutes since she became a household name.</p>

<p>But Monica has not allowed 1998 to be the last chapter in her story. She's used the fame and notoriety to take back her name.</p>

<p class="redtext" id="lastline">Monica Lewinsky has been redefined. </p>
